# Install:
1. Clone the Repository
2. In the base directory, run ```npm install```
3. Run ```npm start```

# Thoughts
Some next iteration items I'd like to call out that I think would be obvious wins:

1. Using context/redux.  I think I am at the limit of the number of times I'd like to be passing items down from the top level.  I think this could be achieved with just the context api, but assuming the app would get more complex, therefore prompting the change, more complex state management might be useful
2. A search/sort would be easy wins.
3. Better feedback on form validation.
4. SASS/LESS or Styled components.  The CSS here is pretty rough and ready, and I think I just prefer LESS but have enjoyed Styled components in the past.
5. Improve test coverage.
 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
